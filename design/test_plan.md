# Sysadmin Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the sysadmin project, covering both unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability and correctness of the system.

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

#### Parser Module Tests
- **Markdown Parsing**: Test parsing of various markdown structures including headers, text content, and code blocks
- **Code Block Extraction**: Validate extraction of executable code blocks with proper language identification
- **Edge Cases**: Handle empty documents, malformed markdown, and missing language identifiers
- **Header Handling**: Test parsing of different heading levels and section organization

#### Model Module Tests
- **Document Structure**: Validate creation and manipulation of Document and Section objects
- **Code Block Handling**: Test extraction and filtering of executable code blocks
- **Step Counting**: Verify accurate counting of executable steps

#### Block Module Tests
- **Language Mapping**: Test interpreter selection for various programming languages
- **Shell Detection**: Validate shell-like language detection logic

#### UI Module Tests
- **Renderer Functionality**: Test rendering of headers, text, and code blocks with proper formatting
- **Prompt Handling**: Validate shell prompt rendering

#### Executor Module Tests
- **Interactive Execution Flow**: Test the interactive execution process
- **Shell Integration**: Validate sub-shell spawning and prompt handling

### 2. Integration Tests

#### End-to-End Workflow Tests
- **Complete Document Processing**: Test full pipeline from file parsing to execution
- **Example File Validation**: Validate processing of example sysadmin files
- **Command Execution Flow**: Test the complete interactive execution flow

#### Cross-Module Integration Tests
- **Parser to Model Integration**: Ensure proper data flow between parser and model components
- **Model to Executor Integration**: Validate that executors receive properly structured data
- **UI Integration Tests**: Test rendering of parsed content in the UI

## Test Files and Examples

### Example Test Files

1. **Basic Document** (`examples/basic.sysadmin`)
   - Simple markdown with various code blocks in different languages
   - Text content between code blocks
   - Section headers

2. **Database Migration** (`examples/database-migration.sysadmin`)
   - Complex multi-step process with multiple code blocks
   - Various shell commands and database operations
   - Documentation between steps

### Test Coverage Areas

#### Parser Tests
- Parse simple documents with one section
- Parse documents with multiple sections and headers
- Handle code blocks without language identifiers (should be treated as text)
- Parse indented code blocks
- Handle edge cases like empty documents and malformed content

#### Model Tests
- Document creation and manipulation
- Section organization and header handling
- Code block extraction and filtering
- Step counting functionality

#### Integration Tests
- Full document parsing and execution flow
- Example file processing with real-world scenarios
- Interactive mode behavior testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Test Approach
1. **Isolated Component Testing**: Each module tested independently with mock dependencies where appropriate
2. **Edge Case Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of boundary conditions and error scenarios
3. **Code Coverage Targets**: Aim for >80% code coverage across all modules

### Integration Test Approach
1. **End-to-End Validation**: Test complete workflows from file input to execution output
2. **Example File Validation**: Ensure real-world example files parse and execute correctly
3. **Cross-Module Verification**: Validate data flow between different system components

### Test Execution Environment
1. **Local Development**: All tests should run on local development environments
2. **Continuous Integration**: Tests should be part of CI pipeline for any changes
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Consider testing on different operating systems where applicable

## Test Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Unit Tests
- Create comprehensive unit tests for all parser components
- Implement model unit tests covering all data structures
- Add block-level unit tests for language handling logic
- Create UI component tests for rendering functionality

### Phase 2: Integration Tests
- Develop integration tests for complete document processing workflows
- Create tests for example files to ensure they work as expected
- Implement end-to-end testing of interactive execution mode

### Phase 3: Test Validation
- Run all tests to ensure they pass
- Validate that example files process correctly
- Verify that the system behaves as expected in various scenarios

## Test Metrics and Success Criteria

### Code Coverage Targets
- Parser: 90%+ code coverage
- Model: 95%+ code coverage  
- UI: 80%+ code coverage
- Executor: 85%+ code coverage

### Performance Targets
- All unit tests should complete in under 1 second
- Integration tests should complete in under 5 seconds
- No regressions in test performance

### Quality Indicators
- All example files should parse and execute correctly
- No runtime errors in interactive mode
- Proper error handling for malformed input files
- Consistent output formatting across all UI components

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Parser Edge Cases**: Malformed markdown or unusual formatting could cause parsing failures
2. **Cross-Module Dependencies**: Changes in one module might break integration with others
3. **Interactive Mode Complexity**: Sub-shell handling and user interaction could introduce issues

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Ensure all edge cases are covered in unit tests
2. **Integration Validation**: Regular end-to-end testing of complete workflows
3. **Example File Validation**: Validate that real-world example files work correctly

## Tools and Frameworks

### Testing Framework
- Rust's built-in test framework (`#[test]` attributes)
- `pretty_assertions` for better diff output in tests

### Test Utilities
- Mocking capabilities for external dependencies where needed
- Test fixtures for common document structures
- Example file validation utilities

## Next Steps

1. Implement unit tests for parser components with comprehensive edge case coverage
2. Create integration tests that validate end-to-end document processing
3. Add example file validation to ensure real-world usage works correctly
4. Establish CI pipeline for automated test execution
5. Monitor code coverage and expand tests as needed
