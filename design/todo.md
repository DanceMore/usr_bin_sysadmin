# Sysadmin Project Evaluation and Roadmap

## Task Completed
I've completed the evaluation of the sysadmin project design and test plan. Here's what I accomplished:

## Design Completeness Analysis
I thoroughly examined the current implementation and found that the core architecture is well-designed with clear separation of concerns (Parser, Model, Executor, UI) following a clean architecture pattern.

## Test Plan Gap Analysis
I identified several gaps in the existing test plan:

- Missing UI component tests (particularly for TUI rendering)
- No error handling tests for malformed input files
- Lack of performance benchmarks and stress tests
- Insufficient integration tests for the executor module
- No cross-platform compatibility testing

## Improved Test Plan
I created a comprehensive feature analysis document that:

- Details the current implementation status
- Identifies gaps in test coverage
- Prioritizes future features based on user needs and technical requirements
- Provides recommendations for immediate improvements and future development

## Feature Roadmap
I outlined a roadmap of features to consider for future development, including:

- YAML front matter support
- Task labels and checkpoints
- Variables and template substitution
- Safety annotations
- Expected output validation
- Parallel execution capabilities
- Web UI enhancements

The sysadmin project shows strong foundational design with a clear path for future feature development. The architecture supports extensibility and modular development, making it well-suited for the planned enhancements.
